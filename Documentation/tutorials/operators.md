# Operators

An Operator is an application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user. It builds upon the basic Kubernetes resource and controller concepts but includes domain or application-specific knowledge to automate common tasks.

Tectonic can optionally install experimental Operators which manage Kubernetes and Tectonic components.

By installing these Operators, you will be able to manage auto-upgrades of Kubernetes via your Tectonic console.
